# Introduction

This was primarily designed for Windows as unfortunately I'm stuck with a garbage gaming laptop instead of something cool like a MacBook Pro. ðŸ˜­

Eventually I will update this script for MacOS but that will have to wait because I cannot be bothered to make something work for a system I don't own.

## Setup

You will need:
 - Streamrip (https://github.com/nathom/streamrip)
 - Beets (https://beets.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
   - I will replace this with Mutagen (https://mutagen.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) at somepoint because Beets is dreadful and makes everything unecessarily difficult.
 - VirtualDJ (https://www.virtualdj.com/download/)
 - Python (but that's obvious)
   - The only extra library needed is beautifulsoup4 (https://pypi.org/project/beautifulsoup4/) and only if you're using the steal_it_from_maltine.py script!

For this to work properly you also need a file in your %userprofile% area called urls (no extension) with each Tidal URL separated on a new line.

There's probably bugs and other weirdness with this but it works well enough for me.

## steal_it.py

The point of this script is to read Tidal URLs from a "urls" file in your %userprofile%, execute the Streamrip command for each of those URLs, process the downloaded files using Beets (I like to have my music reorganised by %albumartist% > %album% - %year%), then after you've opened up VirtualDJ and scanned your files in (you need to do this bit manually) it will add the "recursive" flag to all folders so that you can easily browse files without having to go deep into nested folders which is a pain when you're trying only to use your decks and not touch the mouse/kb whilst DJ'ing.

I am going to remove beets and instead use Mutagen to achieve the %albumartist% sorting as Tidal is pretty lame with how it stores tags, meaning that I need to write something which will get the text up to the first comma (i.e. primary artist) in the %artist% tag and then set the %albumartist% tag to that. Simple enough but I just haven't gotten around to it yet.

## steal_it_if_you_broke_it.py

Let's say you've just downloaded 15,000 tracks and you're really happy with with how your music is organised. Now let's say you've just paid for Mixed In Key and Lexicon to get the best tags possible. Now let's say that both of those pieces of software are actually hot garbage and ruined your music collection with stupid cue points, awful key/energy tags, and other nonsense...

What can you do? Well if you have fast internet, like me, you start from scratch! ðŸ˜Š

This script will convert the Streamrip downloads database to a .csv and then similarly to the above, will execute Streamrip for each track it finds. One day I will make this multithreaded, as it currently works on a track by track basis which is well below the Tidal limits, but that day is not today.

## steal_it_from_maltine.py

This script will scrape all available downloads from Maltine Records, a really cool Japanese web label that put out some crazy good music. I actually only wanted the remix album for Porter Robinson's Flicker but then my OCD got the better of me and here we are downloading everything they've got.

This script is buggy as heck, there's a number of URLs that don't work because they don't follow the regular Maltine web design or they just don't have a download available. It'll grab most .zip files for you though!
